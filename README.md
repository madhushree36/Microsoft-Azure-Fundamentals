Upload one image as well as a short video and set different access  permissions (private and public). ENABLE ACCESS TRACKING and add  a rule in the lifecycle management policies telling that  i. if the page blob which we created is not accessed for 10 days  then change its access tier to cool.  ii. If the blob is not modified for 45 days, delete the blob.  Requires screen recording to be enabled for task submission and  write a 1 page report mentioning the steps to do this task.
